        <p className='para'>
          We've built a world-class payments product that makes it really easy
          for businesses to accept recurring payments. We work with a wide
            variety of businesses from sole traders to multinational
          corporations like TripAdvisor, The Guardian and Box.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          We've gained great traction in the UK, quickly expanding in Europe,
          and now we want to make recurring payments simpler even further
          afield. The opportunity is there, but we need to move fast to become
          a global success. We're looking for results-oriented, adaptable
          self-starters to lead this expansion.
