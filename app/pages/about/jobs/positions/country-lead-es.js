          The role
        </h4>
        <p className='para'>
          We've laid foundations in the UK, and these will
          guide you as you figure out a strategy that will deliver rapid growth
          in Spain. Then you'll execute this strategy, driving in-country
          work independently and resourcefully, and swiftly becoming an expert in your
          market.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You will work closely with leaders across the company to understand all product,
          engineering and operational requirements, so you'll need to be adept at
          discussing complex situations with a wide variety of audiences. You'll
          feed your market's needs into our development roadmap to ensure we're always
          building the product people want.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          All client-facing activities in your market will be your responsibility: planning
          and delivering on launch activities to build momentum early; accompanying
          prospective customers from sales to live. You'll handle initial marketing,
          PR, sales, partnerships and account management, and start to build a team
          to support &amp; scale growth in your market.

          Launching GoCardless in a new territory will require a depth and breadth of
          skills akin to starting a new company. It's an exciting challenge, and you'll
          benefit from the support and experience of our existing country leads.
          One of your first tasks will be to start building your team, hiring someone
          whose strengths complement your own to assist you as you forge a path
          for success in Spain.
