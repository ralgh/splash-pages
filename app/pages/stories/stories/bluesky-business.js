          <p>Bluesky Business provide professional book-keeping and accounting services. As a growing business, it was important for them to maintain a strong cashflow to finance new hires, and maintain a clear sales ledger and forecast.</p>
          <p>“Only 20% of our customers were paying within the required 30 days. We used to spend two full days a month just chasing clients for payment up to three months late,” says Emma Mills, Director.</p>

          Our cashflow and business have been transformed since we started using GoCardless.
          Within a month our average debtor days had halved and 70% of our customers were paying on time.
          We&quo;re wasting less time chasing payments, and can really focus on growing our business

          <p>
            Bluesky needed an assured payment system that integrated with their Sage 50 accounts, and quickly turned to the GoCardless add-on.
            Now, when each invoice is due, it is automatically collected from client's accounts, and marked as "paid" in Sage.
